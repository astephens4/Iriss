These are the directions for setting up the Arm toolchain on Ubuntu 12.04. This toolchain and it's locations are referenced throughout 
various build configurations in the project. The toolchain is used to compile the IRISS Raspberry Pi projects, 3rd Party Libraries, and kernel.

1. If you are using 64-bit Ubuntu, install the 32-bit libraries the toolchain needs to run:
	sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

2. Download the tool chain from the Raspberry Pi Github:
	git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git ./raspi_tc

3. Set up the installation location in /opt:
	mkdir -p /opt/{build,mkimage}
	sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/build
	sudo chgroup -R $(whoami) /opt/build
	sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/mkimage
	sudo chgroup -R $(whoami) /opt/mkimage

4. Copy the toolchain we are using into the /opt/build directory
	cp -rf ~/raspi_tc/arm-bcm2708/arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi /opt/build

5. Copy the mkimage tool into /opt/mkimage
	cp -rf ~/raspi_tc/mkimage /opt/mkimage

6. Test to see if the installation worked:
	cd <IrissProjDir>/raspi/3rdParty/
	./buildAll debug
